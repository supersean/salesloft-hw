show list of people records from API
-name
-email address
-job title

button, which clicked, gives frequency count of unizue characters across all people emails, sorted

2nd button to show possible duplicates


Routes:

/home
 (includes people widget, frequency widget, and duplicate widget)

tests:

level1:

	on page:

	test user can see list of people (name, email addr,  job title) with real calls
	test view is displayed with mock
	test pagination is happening

	api:

	(use Webmock)
	test execution paths through index of users
	
	test connection to salesloft
	test authorization with salesloft
	
level2:
	
	test button exists
	test frequency algorithm
	test widget is displayed
	test widget is refreshed

level3:
	
	test button exists
	test duplicate algorithm
	test widget is displayed
	test widget is refreshed


thinking about scaling:

add caching of api requests

test cache somehow
